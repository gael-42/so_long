# so_long

My take on so_long, a 2D game project from 42.

The goal was to create a small game using the Minilibx, 42's graphics library. Game rules: the player has to collect all objects on the maps to unlock the exit, using the least amount of moves. The player can move up, down, left and right, and cannot move through walls. The map needs to be in .ber format, and has to respect certains rules (include player position, exit, at least one collectible, needs to be surrounded by walls, exit and collectibles need to be accessible by the player).

Game assets are from itch.io.
